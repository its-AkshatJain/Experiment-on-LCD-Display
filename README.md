# Experiment-on-LCD-Display
This is a small hardware project that uses Arduino and other modules to display names, numbers, and time. The time indicates how many minutes the Arduino has been running/started.

**Description:**
In the dynamic landscape of electronics and technology, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) technology stands as a cornerstone, seamlessly integrating into countless devices and systems to provide visual information in a clear and concise manner. From digital watches to industrial control panels, LCD displays have become ubiquitous, serving as the interface between users and electronic systems.

The experiment on LCD displays serves as a gateway to understanding the intricacies and possibilities of this versatile display technology. In this project, we delve into the realm of LCD displays to explore their capabilities in presenting various types of information, including numbers, names, and time-related data. By interfacing LCD displays with microcontrollers or development boards, we aim to harness the power of this technology to create compelling visual displays that effectively communicate essential information.

**Materials Required:**
1. LCD Display (16x2)
2. Microcontroller or Development Board (Arduino)
3. Jumper Wires
4. I2C Module (Optional)
5. USB Cable

**Installation Guide:**
1. Install Arduino SDK:
   - Visit the official Arduino website: https://www.arduino.cc/
   - Download the Arduino IDE suitable for your operating system.
   - Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

**Making Connections:**
1. Connect the LCD Display to the Arduino:
   - VCC of LCD to 5V pin on Arduino
   - GND of LCD to GND pin on Arduino
   - SDA of LCD to A4 pin on Arduino
   - SCL of LCD to A5 pin on Arduino

2. Solder the I2C Module to the LCD Display:
   - Ensure the I2C module and the LCD display are properly aligned.
   - Solder the corresponding pins of the I2C module to the designated pins on the back of the LCD display. Typically, this involves connecting VCC to VCC, GND to GND, SDA to SDA, and SCL to SCL.
